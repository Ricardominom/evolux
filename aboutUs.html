                        <h1>Company profile</h1>
                        <p>Over 100 years of history to become a worldwide leader in tile manufacturing and distribution.Roca Tile USA has been growing in the past decades adding showrooms and distribution centers in strategic locations to provide nationwide service. Today, Roca Tile USA is part of a worldwide leader in manufacturing, distributing and marketing of high-quality ceramic and porcelain tile. The company’s product range offers solutions for multiple uses, from versatile wall tile to highly resistant indoor and outdoor floor tiles, including solid colors, marble, wood, concrete, stone, decorative tiles and a wide array of complementary pieces and mosaics.</p>
                        <p>On September 1st, 2021, Roca Tile became part of the LAMOSA GROUP, founded in 1890 by a group of U.S. investors as a small brick factory in Monterrey, Mexico’s industrial cradle and later purchased by Bernardo Elosua & Viviano Valdes in 1929. 130 years later, Lamosa has become one of the largest manufacturers of ceramic tile in the world with 20 tile production plants in 6 different countries, with yearly production exceeding well over 200 million square meters. All this is possible thanks to the now 9,000 employees who have managed to take the company to its current position, following the company’s drive for constant innovation and continuous improvement in products and a company culture based on service, technology and sustainable innovation. Through the acquisition of Roca Tile, the Lamosa Group continues its course as a pioneer in the industry, hoping to exceed customer expectations and stay ahead of market trends.</p>
